This is the source code of the Titan Engine. Titan Engine is available under a modified BSD license in the following direction. The license is detailed in LICENSE.txt.

This code has been compiled without any problems with VisalC++ 6.0, but older versions may also work. In order to compile the code you have to add the following folders to include the search path:
code/extern/include/
code/game logic/include/
code/input/include/
code/rfrontend/include/
code/shared/include/

and those to the library search path:
code/extern/lib/
code/game logic/lib/
code/input/lib/
code/rfrontend/lib/
code/shared/lib/

That could be done with some sort of macro, but I didn't know how to do that. If you know it, we will be pleased if you tell it to us.
